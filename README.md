#PongArcadeGame
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle module.
The game allows two players to control paddles and compete against each other to score points by bouncing a ball back and forth.
If a player fails to bounce the ball by touching it with their paddle,  the opponent gets a point.

#Features
Two-player mode: Play against a friend on the same keyboard.
Realistic ball physics: The ball's speed increases after each bounce.
Score tracking: The game keeps track of each player's score.
